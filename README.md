## Credits

This project was based on the guidance from https://github.com/ryanlopezzzz/EEG with a modified circuit and new code for data-gathering, analysis, and gameplay. The repository had amazing explanations for everything and Ryan was great help when we reached out to him with questions. Much of their code no longer works as of January 2023 so we hope our project can help others replicate something similar for getting started with BCIs and EEG.
